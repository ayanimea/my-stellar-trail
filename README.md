4. Launch from your home screen or app drawer

**Benefits**: Works offline, faster loading, native app experience

### Offline Download Package

**Download the full website for offline use without build tools!**

1. Go to the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/aurorae-haven/aurorae-haven/actions/workflows/upload-pages-artifact.yml)
2. Click on the latest successful workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `offline-package`
5. Extract the `.tar.gz` file:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf aurorae-haven-offline-*.tar.gz
   ```

6. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser - no server needed!

   ```bash
   # Optional: Serve with a local server for PWA installation
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

**What's included**: Complete static website with all assets, service worker, and PWA manifest. Built with relative paths so it works directly from your file system!

### Development Setup

- **Dependencies**:
  - Node.js 14+ (for building)
  - Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

- **Build Instructions**:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
  npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
  ```

## 💾 Data Management

### Storage Architecture

- **IndexedDB**: Primary storage for structured data (tasks, habits, schedules, stats)
- **OPFS**: File attachments with metadata references in IndexedDB
- **localStorage**: Fallback and UI state (brain dump content, tags, version history)
- **Automatic Backups**: Daily backups stored in IndexedDB (keeps last 10)

### Features

- ✅ **Export**: Download all data as JSON file with timestamp and UUID
- ✅ **Import**: Restore from any previous export with validation
- ✅ **Auto-Migration**: Automatic migration from localStorage to IndexedDB
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Works with both old and new storage systems

### Storage Limits

- **localStorage**: ~5-10 MB (fallback)
- **IndexedDB**: ~50 MB+ (primary, varies by browser)
- **OPFS**: Limited by available disk space

### Documentation

- [Data Management Architecture](./docs/DATA_MANAGEMENT.md) - Full technical documentation
- [Migration Guide](./docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) - Upgrade from localStorage
- [Import/Export Guide](./docs/IMPORT_EXPORT_GUIDE.md) - Backup and restore instructions

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable, offline-capable, app-like experience
- **ReactJS**: Modular component-based architecture for maintainability
- **HTML5 & CSS**: Modern web standards with responsive design
- **IndexedDB**: Structured data storage with indexes and transactions
- **OPFS**: File system access for attachments
- **Service Worker**: Enables offline functionality and caching strategies
- **Web Manifest**: Provides app metadata for installation
- **Modular Components**: Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns

### Deployment

The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to `main` or `feature-*` branches.
The deployment workflow:

1. Runs tests and security audits
2. Installs Node.js dependencies
3. Builds the React application with Vite (`npm run build`)
4. Automatically generates PWA assets (service worker, manifest, icons) via vite-plugin-pwa
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages

**Build Tool**: Vite (fast, modern bundler with HMR)
**Live URL**: `https://aurorae-haven.github.io/aurorae-haven/`
